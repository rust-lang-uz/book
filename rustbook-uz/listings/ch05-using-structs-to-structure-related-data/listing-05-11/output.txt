error[E0277]: `Kvadrat` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
  --> src/main.rs:12:29
   |
12 |     println!("kvadrat1 is {}", kvadrat1);
   |                             ^^^^^ `Kvadrat` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
   |
   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Kvadrat`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
